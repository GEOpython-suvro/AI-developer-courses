# LLM best practice:
**Be specific:** Provide detail and context about your problem \
**Assign a role:** Assign a role to tailor the output you receive \
**Request an expert opinion:** Assign an expert role and ask the LLM to evaluate the work you've already done to further refine it \
**Give feedback:** Iteratively prompt the LLM and provide feedback on the output you receive to get closer to your expected results \
