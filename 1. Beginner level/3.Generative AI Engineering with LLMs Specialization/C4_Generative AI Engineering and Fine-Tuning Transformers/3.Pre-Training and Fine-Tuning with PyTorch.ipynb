    "Estimated time needed: **60** minutes\n",

    "As a machine learning engineer working for a streaming site, your objective is to develop a recommender system based on written movie reviews. Given that the dataset for these reviews is relatively small, your strategy leverages a larger, accessible dataset of magazine articles. The plan is to pretrain the model on this expansive magazine dataset to capture a broad understanding of text and language patterns. Subsequently, the model will undergo fine-tuning on the smaller, specific dataset of movie reviews to adapt its learned features to the particular task of recommending movies.\n",

    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning a pretrained model can be approached in several ways, each with its advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training the model on the small movie dataset:**\n",
    "   - **Advantages:** Directly training on the movie review data ensures that the model is highly specialized and tailored to the specific characteristics and nuances of the dataset.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages:** Due to the small size of the dataset, the model is at a higher risk of overfitting. There might not be enough data to effectively capture all of the complexities of language and sentiment in movie reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pretraining the model on a larger general-domain text and fine-tuning the movie dataset for each parameter:**\n",
    "   - **Advantages:** This approach allows every part of the model to learn from the movie reviews, potentially improving its accuracy on the specific task.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages:** Fine-tuning all parameters with a small dataset can still lead to overfitting. It also requires huge computational resources and time, as adjustments across all parameters might lead to numerous iterations of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fine-tuning on the final layer only:**\n",
    "   - **Advantages:** Fine-tuning only the final layer reduces the risk of overfitting, as the bulk of the model retains its pretrained structure. This method is faster and less resource-intensive.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages:** Because only the final layer is adjusted, the model might not fully adapt to the specifics of the movie reviews, potentially limiting its effectiveness in understanding deeper contextual nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method offers a balance between adapting to the specifics of the movie review dataset and maintaining the robustness and generalizability learned from the larger magazine article dataset. Choosing the right strategy depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the project, such as available computational resources, the urgency of deployment, and the desired accuracy and specificity of the recommender system.\n"

    "The **IMDB dataset** contains movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) and is commonly used for binary sentiment classification tasks. It's a popular dataset for training and testing models in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in the context of sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset composition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reviews**: The dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews, divided evenly into 25,000 training and 25,000 testing samples.\n",
    "- **Sentiment labels**: Each review is labeled as either positive or negative, indicating the sentiment expressed in the review. The dataset is balanced, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews in both the training and testing sets.\n",
    "- **Text content**: Reviews are presented as plain text and have been preprocessed to some extent. For example, HTML tags are removed, but the text retains its original punctuation and capitalization.\n",
    "- **Usage**: The dataset is commonly used to train models for binary sentiment classification, where the goal is to predict whether a given review is positive or negative based on its text content.\n",

      "(0, '(Only minor spoilers except as noted).<br /><br />I\\'ve enjoyed a lot of Spanish cinema recently; both the actual Spanish cinema of people like Almodovar, and the Latin American cinema of directors like del Toro, whose superb \"Devil\\'s Backbone\", set in Civil War Spain, was the finest horror film of the last decade. It\\'s no surprise, then, that this film is both well-made, well-acted, and manages to sustain that distinctively different Spanish atmosphere. But it\\'s also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see.<br /><br />What actually is the purpose of all this? We have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree, despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice-over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal. In a routinely unpleasant opening sequence, set more than a decade earlier, we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control-freakery (\"\\x85if I can\\'t have you nobody can\\x85.\"). Oddly enough, that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film, but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree, which appears completely different in both motivation and execution. What happened to him in jail to cause this change? We have no idea, though we do later discover, as an absurd sort of afterthought, that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned.<br /><br />In Britain, in several of our notorious \"serial killer\" or \"sex killer\" cases, the terrible question arises; what about the wife? Did she know, or suspect what was going on? This is a question that this film could have asked, and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters. But banally, the answer to the question is quite clearly: \"No, she didn\\'t\". Even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate, the film still manages to bungle it. All we actually get, sketched perfunctorily out at the end, is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event. Compare this to the awful revelatory moment in Ten Rillington Place, where Christie\\'s wife says \"you know what I mean\\x85.\" thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror.<br /><br />(Major spoiler in this paragraph). In the meantime, we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police, thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again. How exactly did he achieve this? The plot gets extremely sketchy at this point; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police; but how this all works or why, or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds, remains a mystery.<br /><br />I actually don\\'t believe serial killers are like this. The Silence of the Lambs may be comic book stuff, but \\x96 Lecter aside \\x96 it gets its serial killers right. They are deeply disturbed, deeply dysfunctional, deeply inadequate people; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here (closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of The Last Horror Movie, or indeed even Man Bites Dog, though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire).<br /><br />This film has little suspense, and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated. It has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers, either generally, or in the specific cultural milieu of Spain. This is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women. And oddly, what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented. The soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory. Just one explicit shot, properly timed, would have been infinitely more shocking, and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary, freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation. Instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear. Very, very creepy. I\\'m sorry to be rude; I love horror films, and can tolerate even the most extreme, to the extent even of worrying my partner. But I think anyone who finds this film good, or interesting, even I\\'d find myself edging away from. The purpose of a horror film is to scare you; this is just lascivious.<br /><br />It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed. I have to give this film more than one star just because it\\'s competently executed, but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made.')\n",

The only reason the film is to be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. This is not enough however, as the story line is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place - I kept asking myself all over the picture whether I am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script-writer wanted, or about the innocent kid who is in the middle.

What I would like to say is that 'Distortion' was shown at a film festival in Geneva in November 2005 (Festival 'Cinéma tout écran') where it won the award of the audience ('Prix du public'in French). For what affects me, I liked the 'nervous camera' work of Mr Bouzaglo, who, in my opinion, portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well, and I think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie. This perspective, however, might seem totally 'alien' to an Israeli viewer, but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers, because Switzerland is a country which has NEVER been subject to any terrorist attack. It therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in Geneva judged this film with a much more 'detached' perspective.I would also like to quote what Mr Bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a Geneva newspaper (I'm translating from French): ''After 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence, we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal.We might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living. We are like the characters in my movie,''on the edge of the edge''. This is the reason why the private detective, who is somehow ''voyeur'' is the happiest character in the movie, because he earns a living thanks to the system, he takes advantage of this situation'' This is, in substance, the main thing that I and the swiss public, in my opinion, pointed out in this movie, and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor. So, to sum up, different country=different perspective, but I think that this is somehow great, because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema, that is to say that it well never be subject to a 'unique' of 'formatted' way of thinking.\")\n",

So, when the final fight occurs between Jack and Bob, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will rise justifiable rage against Bob help or hinder his performance? Tune in and see.<br /><br />This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery-suspense films, back in the 1920s, Hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote (he did both for this film). In fact, in many ways this film is more indicative of Hitchcock's silent style, as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents, THE MANXMAN (also starring Carl Brisson as the wronged husband). So, while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day, it was not a radical departure for this great director--even with its rather formulaic ending.<br /><br />Overall, while a bit predictable and having Ian Hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly, the film works well.

I can picture DeForrest Kelley watching the film and saying to himself - \\'I\\'ll have to use that sometime\\'.<br /><br />Once the killer\\'s identity is revealed, it doesn\\'t seem like such a big surprise, but up till then it\\'s really anybody\\'s guess. But Archer and Brisbane Coe aside, the film didn\\'t answer the central question posed by the title, and the murder I was really interested in - who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald\\'s dog Ghillie?')\n",
      "(1, \"'I only wanted to see you laughing in the Purple Rain.' This is an excell film. It should have been re-rated to PG-13. But anyways, Prince's first film and greatest. The follow-up sucked. But I haven't seen for years so here's what I can remember about it. The Kid (Prince) has to juggle with winning over the love of his life, Apollonia (herself), keeping his band together (The Revolution as themselves) and the tension in his family. But his rival band (The Time as themselves) is ruining his life. Like Morris (himself) is trying to steal Apollonia from The Kid. Just like Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent it, laugh and cry and if you luv it, buy it.\")\n"
