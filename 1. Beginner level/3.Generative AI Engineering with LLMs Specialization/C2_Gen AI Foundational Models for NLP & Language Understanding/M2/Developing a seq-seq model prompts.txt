#**Sequence-to-Sequence RNN Models: Translation Task**#
In this hands-on guide, we will explore the fundamentals of sequence-to-sequence models and learn how to implement an RNN-based model for a translation task using PyTorch.

#Objectives:
After completing this lab, we will be able to:
 - Comprehend recurrent neural networks (RNN) architecture
 - Create an Encoder-Decoder model for a translation task
 - Train and evaluate the model
 - Create a generator for the translation task
 - Explain concepts related to Perplexity and BLEU score and use them for evaluating translations
