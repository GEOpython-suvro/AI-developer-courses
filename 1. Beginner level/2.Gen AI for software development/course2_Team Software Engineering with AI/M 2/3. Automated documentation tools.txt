For simplicity and Markdown support: Use MkDocs.
For Python-only projects: Use pdoc or Pycco.
For multi-language projects: Use Doxygen.
For built-in, quick documentation: Use Pydoc.
For complex, detailed docs with reStructuredText: Use Sphinx.

def calculate_area(radius):
    """
    Calculate the area of a circle given its radius.

    :param radius: The radius of the circle.
    :type radius: float
    :return: The area of the circle.
    :rtype: float
    """
    pi = 3.14159
    return pi * radius * radius
